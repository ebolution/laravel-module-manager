# Ebolution ModuleManager

This module aims to manage common tasks from a modular point of view. The ultimate goal is to emulate what this 
module https://nwidart.com/laravel-modules/v6/introduction does in a very basic way, letting the developers 
encapsulate the most of the features in separate modules without following the main development flow established by 
Laravel, where all the code of the application lives in the folder `app`.
